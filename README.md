This project consists of two Python-based cybersecurity modules: a **Brute-Force Login Tester** and a **Port Scanner**, both designed to demonstrate foundational ethical hacking techniques. The `brute_forcer.py` module performs a brute-force attack on a web login form by sending multiple username-password combinations to a specified URL, checking the response for success or failure without triggering security filters. It helps in understanding how weak credentials can be exploited if input validation or rate-limiting is not enforced. The `port_scanner.py` module scans a target IP or domain for open ports from a given list using Pythonâ€™s `socket` library, identifying which services might be exposed and potentially vulnerable. Both tools are lightweight, CLI-based, and ideal for students or beginners in ethical hacking to learn how basic attacks work in real scenarios. They emphasize the importance of securing login pages against brute-force attacks and closing unused ports to prevent unauthorized access, making this mini project a practical learning resource in the field of network and web application security.
